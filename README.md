# Scheduling AI

## Search Probelm Description
Overseeing soccer fields around the City of Calgary, we have to assign *Games* and *Practices* to weekly field time *Slots*.
Each time slot has a different quantity of fields available.

There are several leagues across the city. Each league has a desire to book time slots for weekly games for each of its divisions. As a result, we have a set $`Games = \{ g_1, ..., g_m\}`$ of weekly games slots to book where one $`g_i`$ is the weekly games slots to book for a division ùëñùëñ in a league which may have multiple divisions.

We also have a set $`Practices = \{p_{11}, ..., p_{1k_1}, ..., p_{m1}, ..., p_{mk_m}\}`$ of practices associated with those divisional games.

Practice $`p_{i1}, ... p_{ik_i}`$ are associated with teams involved in the games $`g_i`$ of a particular division $`i`$. Note, if $`k_i = 0`$ this would mean the division does not have any practices slots to be scheduled.

Finally, we have a set $`Slots = \{s_1, ..., s_n\}`$ of time slots into which games and practices must be assigned.

## Problem Constraints
### Hard Constraints
1. Not more than $`gamemax(s)`$ games can be assigned to each $`s ‚àà Slots`$.
2. Not more than $`practicemax(s)`$ practices can be assigned to each $`s ‚àà Slots`$.
3. $`assign(g_i) ‚â† assign(p_{ik_i})`$ for all $`i`$ and $`k_i`$.
4. Some divisions allow players to play in both divisions and therefore want to make their games/practices not happen at the same time. The input for your system will contain a list of $`notcompatible(a,b)`$ statements, with $`a, b ‚àà Games + Practices`$. For each of those, $`assign(a) ‚â† assign(b)`$.
5. Sometimes there are certain divisions that already have pre-arrangements for certain slots. The input for the system can contain a partial assignment $`partassign: Games + Practices ‚Üí Slots + \{\$\}.`$ (\$ is a placeholder for no pre-assignment.) The assignment $`assign`$ the system produces has to fulfill the condition:
$`assign(a) = partassign(a)`$ for all $`a \in Games + Practices`$ with  $partassign(a) ‚â† \$$.
6. The input for your system can contain a list of $`unwanted(a,s)`$ statements, with $`a ‚àà Games + Practices`$ and $`s ‚àà Slots`$. For each of those $`assign(a) ‚â† s`$ must be true.
7. There will be additional hard constraints specific to the City of Calgary that will be explained later.
### Soft Constraints
1. There are certain times of the day that nobody prefers but we‚Äôd like our system to produce a result that attempts to spread out the usage of our resources. To accomplish this, we‚Äôll define a soft constraint which is a minimum level of usage we‚Äôd like a slot to achieve. To facilitate this, we have for each slot $`s`$ a $`gamemin(s)`$ and $`practicemin(s)`$ that indicate how many games, resp. practices, should at least be scheduled into the slot $`s`$. The system accepts as input penalty values $`pen_{gamemin}`$ and $`pen_{practicemin}`$ (as command line arguments) and for each games below $`gamemin`$ we will get $`pen_{gamemin}`$ and for each practice $`pen_{practivemin}`$ added to the Eval-value of an assignment.
2. Certain leagues have certain preferences regarding in which time slots their games and practices should be scheduled. Naturally, we see this as something that should be treated as soft constraint. Higher age groups and tiers are awarded a certain number of ranking points and lower ones fewer ranking points. Each league can distribute these points over pairs of (game/practice, time slots). Formally, we assume a function $`preference: (Games + Practice) √ó Slots ‚Üí ‚Ñï`$ that reports those preferences. (i.e. we have a function that indicates a numerical natural number score of the preference of a game or practice being assigned to a slot.) For each assignment in $`assign`$, we add up the preference-values for a games/practices that refer to a different slot as the penalty that is added to the Eval-value of $`assign`$.
3. For certain games and/or practices, we might prefer these to be scheduled at the same time. To facilitate this, there will be a list of $`pair(a,b)`$ statements in the input for your system, with $`a, b ‚àà Games + Practices`$ and a parameter $`pen_{notpaired}`$ for your system. For every ùíëùíë (ùíÇ ,ùíÉ ) statement, for which (a) is not equal to (b), you have to add ùëùùëùùëù ùëõùëõùëõ ùëõùëõ ùëõùëõ to the Eval-value of $`assign`$.

## Instantiation
### Games/Practice Naming
In Calgary, weekly games to be booked games are identified by an organizing body, an age group (and often a tier within that age group), and division in the age group. For example, the main soccer body in Calgary is CMSA who has several different age groups/tiers it operates, but there are also leagues like CUSA and CSSC that operate in the city. A league will have an indicator that includes the division in that sub-league that looks like:
<br />
**CMSA U12T1 DIV 01**
<br />
For Calgary Minor Soccer Association - Under 12 - Tier 1 - Division 1.
Practices add on the end of this indicator
<br />
CMSA U12T1 DIV 01 **PRC 01**
<br />
is practice 1 for CMSA U12T1 DIV 01. If a practice is used by all divisions of the age/tier level, then we drop the division
<br />
CMSA U12T1 PRC 01
<br />
Sometimes a league doesn‚Äôt book practices but instead generally creates open field access for their division. Instead of PRC we will see indicator OPN. You will be able to treat OPN as synonymous with PRC for this project as field bookings operate identically.
<br />
CMSA U12T1 DIV 01 **OPN 01**

### Time Slots
The available time slots depend on the day of the week and whether we look at *games* or *practices*.

Mondays and Wednesdays, the slots available for games and practices are 8:00-9:00, 9:00-10:00, 10:00-11:00, 11:00-12:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:00-15:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:00-17:00, 17:00-18:00, 18:00-19:00, 19:00-20:00 and 20:00-21:00. The same slots are available for *games* also on Fridays.

The available time slots for Tuesdays and Thursdays for games are 8:00-9:30, 9:30-11:00, 11:00-12:30, 12:30-14:00, 14:00-15:30, 15:30-17:00, 17:00-18:30 and 18:30-20:00. For practices, the available time slots are the same on Tuesdays and Thursdays as previously given for Mondays and Wednesdays practices.

The slots available for practices on Fridays are 8:00-10:00, 10:00-12:00, 12:00-14:00, 14:00-16:00, 16:00-18:00, 18:00-20:00.

All slots beginning at 18:00 or later are called evening slots.

Note that the fact that the slots for games and practices on Tuesdays and Thursdays are not following the same time scheme requires you to deal with time and how time
slots may overlap. It also seems that this contradicts the general problem scheme, but it can be reformulated in terms of the general problem.

Our City of Calgary problem has the following hard constraints:
- If a division‚Äôs games (Ex. CMSA U12T1 DIV 01) are put into a slot on Mondays, then they must be put into the corresponding time slots on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, these three time slots are treated as one abstract slot, which allows us to see our Calgary problem as an instantiation of the general problem!
- Similarly, if a division‚Äôs games are put into a slot on Tuesdays, then they must be put into the corresponding time slots on Thursdays.
- If a practice (ex. CMSA U12T1 DIV 01 PRC 01) is put into a slot on Mondays, it must be put into the corresponding time slots on Wednesdays.
- If a practice is put into a slot on Tuesdays, it must be put into the corresponding time slots on Thursdays.
- Fridays are single practice slots and not linked with other days.
- All divisions with a division number starting DIV 9 are evening divisions and must be scheduled into evening slots.
- All games in all tiers of the U15/U16/U17/U19 level must be scheduled into non-overlapping time slots.
- No games can be scheduled on Tuesdays 11:00-12:30 as a league wide meeting occurs weekly at this time for admin.
- There are two special "game bookings" CMSA U12T1S and CMSA U13T1S that must be scheduled Tuesdays / Thursdays 18:00-19:00. CMSA U12T1S is not allowed to overlap with any practices/games of CMSA U12T1 and CMSA U13T1S is not allowed to overlap with any practices/games of CMSA U13T1. These two "game bookings" are a way of schedule special showcase tryouts series for these divisions‚Äô players for selection to special provincial teams for Alberta Games.

The City of Calgary also has the following soft constraints:
- Different divisional games within a single age/tier group should be scheduled at different times. For each pair of divisions that is scheduled into the same slot, we add a penalty $`pen_{section}`$ to the Eval-value of an assignment *assign*. Ex. U12T1 DIV 01 and U12T1 DIV 02 should not be scheduled at same time slot, if possible, for a better Eval score.
